## Problem Statement

> Design a responsive web application that helps users identify and visualize patterns in their daily health or lifestyle habits (such as sleep, mood, water intake, or symptoms) and provides simple, actionable insights based on the collected data.

**Additional challenges addressed:**
- Healthcare systems are slow and crowded
- Students lack centralized learning tools
- No single platform connects patients, doctors, and students
- Language barriers in healthcare access

---

## Solution

A **unified AI-powered platform** that simplifies healthcare access and medical education in one place. Each user role gets a **completely different dashboard** with tailored features:

| Role | What They Get |
|------|--------------|
| **Patient** | AI health chat, daily habit tracking with pattern visualization, appointment booking, medicine info, lab reports, fee payment with queue tokens |
| **Medical Student** | AI study tutor, organized notes & previous year papers, video lectures, study planner |
| **Doctor** | AI clinical assistant, patient management, appointment scheduling, digital reports |
| **Professor** | AI teaching aide, material sharing, student query management, class scheduling |
| **Admin** | User management dashboard, approve/block users, view registrations by role |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React 19, Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3 |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI, Lucide Icons |
| **Charts** | Recharts (interactive data visualizations) |
| **Animations** | Motion (Framer Motion) |
| **Backend** | Node.js API Routes (REST) |
| **Database** | MongoDB (native driver) with localStorage fallback |
| **State** | localStorage for client-side persistence |
| **Theme** | Dark/Light mode with next-themes |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** — [Download](https://nodejs.org)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** (optional) — [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone or extract the project
cd web

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB URI (optional — app works without it)

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 5. Open in browser
# http://localhost:3000
```

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server (port 3000) |
| `npm run build` | Create production build |
| `npm start` | Run production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint checks |

### MongoDB Setup (Optional)

The app works **with or without MongoDB**. When MongoDB isn't running, it gracefully falls back to localStorage.

```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# macOS
brew services start mongodb-community

# Docker
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
```

Then set in `.env`:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai_health_assist
```

## How the Health Insights Engine Works

The AI insights engine analyzes 14 days of health data and detects patterns:

1. **Sleep-Mood Correlation** — Compares mood scores on days with 7+ hours sleep vs. <6 hours
2. **Exercise-Mood Boost** — Measures mood improvement on exercise days vs. rest days
3. **Hydration-Symptom Link** — Correlates low water intake with symptom frequency
4. **Goal Tracking** — Checks sleep, water, and exercise against user-set targets
5. **Recurring Symptoms** — Identifies symptoms appearing 3+ times in 2 weeks
6. **Nutrition Analysis** — Calculates healthy meal percentage and trends
7. **Mood Trends** — Detects sustained high or low mood patterns
8. **Exercise Consistency** — Measures weekly exercise frequency against goals

Each insight includes a **priority level** (high/medium/low), **category**, and **actionable suggestion**.

---

## Future Scope

- Real AI/LLM integration (OpenAI, Google Gemini) for smarter chat responses
- Full MongoDB persistence for all features (currently localStorage-first)
- JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Push notifications for medicine reminders and appointments
- PDF report generation and download
- Telemedicine video calling
- Wearable device integration (Fitbit, Apple Health)
- Advanced analytics with ML-based health predictions
- Hospital/institution multi-tenancy
- Mobile app (React Native)

## Hackathon Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Our project is an AI-powered multi-role healthcare and education platform that supports patients, medical students, doctors, and professors. It provides personalized dashboards, AI assistance, health habit tracking with pattern visualization, appointment booking, and learning support. Due to time constraints, we developed a prototype focusing on role-based interaction, health analytics, and AI chatbot functionality, with future scope for full hospital and academic integration."
